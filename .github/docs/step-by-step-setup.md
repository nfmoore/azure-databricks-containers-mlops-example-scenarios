# Step-by-Step Setup

The purpose of this section is to describe the steps required to setup each example scenario.

> [!TIP]
>
> - Its recommended to complete the setup using a [GitHub Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/prebuilding-your-codespaces/about-github-codespaces-prebuilds) or local VSCode environment with the environment specified in the [development container](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers). This will be the most efficient way to complete the setup.
> - The example scenarios are designed to be executed in sequence.

> [!WARNING]
>
> - As with all Azure Deployments, this will incur associated costs. Remember to teardown all related resources after use to avoid unnecessary costs.
> - If you use a GitHub Codespace you may encounter HTTP 403 errors when executing GitHub CLI commands. If you encounter these issues try executing `export GITHUB_TOKEN=` to overwrite the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable then execute `gh auth login`. Codespaces also uses GITHUB_TOKEN, but the token used is less permissive.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Common setup section should take 25 minutes to complete.

## Prerequisites

Before implementing this example scenario the following is needed:

- Azure subscription with Owner permissions.
- GitHub account.

## 1. Common Setup

## 1.1. Create a GitHub repository

1. Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to the [azure-databricks-containers-mlops-example-scenarios](https://github.com/nfmoore/azure-databricks-containers-mlops-example-scenarios) repository and click `Use this template` to create a new repository from this template.

    Rename the template and leave it public. Ensure you click `Include all branches` to copy all branches.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - You can learn more about creating a repository from a template [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository).

## 1.2. Configure a federated identity credential on a service principal

1. Create a Microsoft Entra application by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    az ad app create --display-name <your-display-name>
    ```

    Take note of the `appId` value (the Application ID or Client ID) returned by the command as it will be used in the next step.

2. Create a Microsoft Entra service principal by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    az ad sp create --id <your-application-id>
    ```

    Take note of the `id` value (the Object ID or Principal ID) returned by the command as it will be used in the next step.

3. Assign the service principal as a `Owner` of an Azure subscription by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    az role assignment create \
    --role "Owner" \
    --assignee-object-id <your-object-id> \
    --assignee-principal-type ServicePrincipal \
    --scope /subscriptions/<your-subscription-id>
    ```

4. Create federated credentials for your Microsoft Entra application by executing the following command:

    ```bash
    # set environment variables for the federated credentials
    export APPLICATION_ID=<your-application-id> # replace with your application id
    export REPOSITORY_NAME=example-scenarios-databricks-containers-mlops # replace with your repository name
    export OWNER=<your-username># replace with your GitHub username

    # create federated credential for workflows targeting the Production environment
    az ad app federated-credential create \
    --id $APPLICATION_ID \
    --parameters '{
        "name": "ProductionEnvironmentCredential",
        "issuer": "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com",
        "subject": "repo:'${OWNER}'/'${REPOSITORY_NAME}':environment:Production",
        "description": "Federated credential for workflows in the Production environment",
        "audiences": [ "api://AzureADTokenExchange" ]
    }'

    # create federated credential for jobs tied to the Staging environment
    az ad app federated-credential create \
    --id $APPLICATION_ID \
    --parameters '{
        "name": "StagingEnvironmentCredential",
        "issuer": "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com",
        "subject": "repo:'${OWNER}'/'${REPOSITORY_NAME}':environment:Staging",
        "description": "Federated credential for jobs tied to the Staging environment",
        "audiences": [ "api://AzureADTokenExchange" ]
    }'

    # create federated credential for jobs tied to the main branch
    az ad app federated-credential create \
    --id $APPLICATION_ID \
    --parameters '{
        "name": "MainBranchCredential",
        "issuer": "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com",
        "subject": "repo:'${OWNER}'/'${REPOSITORY_NAME}':ref:refs/heads/main",
        "description": "Federated credential for jobs tied to the main branch",
        "audiences": [ "api://AzureADTokenExchange" ]
    }'
    ```

After executing these steps you will have a federated identity credential on a service principal that can be used to authenticate with Azure services. This can be viewed in Microsoft Entra by navigating to the `App registrations` blade and selecting the application created in step 1.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Ensure note of the Client ID, Tenant ID and Subscription ID as they will be used in the next steps.
> - More information about  setting up an Azure Login with OpenID Connect and use it in a GitHub Actions workflow is available [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure?tabs=azure-cli).
